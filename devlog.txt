DEVLOG (Team lame)

Instructions:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
The devlog should be a plain text file, stored in the specified location.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github, they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format: firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )

- noticed an error with the Weather API (specifically with the geocoder library); commented it out and notified Liam (who will work on it)
- created separate pages for login and register functions (updated __init__.py accordingly and split main.html into login.html and register.html)
- created and began styling login.html and register.html
- updated and began styling error.html
- created style.css (and began experimenting with Foundation)
- added a register button to login page (takes user from login page to register page)
- a cancel button to register page (takes user from register page to login page)
- added error messages for all errors, as well as correct routes for user to "try again"
- experiencing an error when at the root route --> "Method Not Allowed. The method is not allowed for the requested URL."
    - I added methods=["POST"] to the root route, so it now is @app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
    - root route works well if you start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/logout?Submit=Logout, click the sign up button, and then the cancel button, bringing you back to the root route
    - does not work if you immediately go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

ethanS -- 2021-04-28 1:49
- fixed root route error from prev. entry
- also fixed bug that was preventing new user registration
    - led me to converting all instances of UUIDs into strings for SQL queries
- continued work on to-do list, notable fixes need to be made are written as TODOs in doc
- added specific error messages on login failure, either "username does not exist" or "user/pass is incorrect", doesn't specify which for security reasons

ameliaC, maddyA -- 2021-04-28 14:40
- added styling to login.html, register.html, error.html pages --> now they all look very cohesive and aesthetic! 
- added footnotes with team lame's roster at the bottom of every html page
- spent an insane amount of time deciding on a color palette
- struggled with problems with wacky margins/padding (didn't fully figure it out but that's okay) 

maddyA -- 2021-04-28 19:30
- continued working on styling after wrapping up call with Amelia
- added a banner to the main study buddy page (user_page.html) with personalized greeting
- stylized buttons on main study buddy page to match buttons on login.html and register.html
- played around with padding on login and register pages --> still not perfect, but better than it was
- tried dog facts api --> there seems to be a problem with the api itself (even http calls from the browswer do not work), so we aren't including it in our project

maddyA, ethanS -- 2021-04-29 12:30
- created a function to add error messages directly to login page (username or password is incorrect) and to register page (username is already taken)
- created a random_error() function to handle all other errors (general "Oops! Something went wrong." message)
- added calls to redirect rather than function calls at ends of each utiltiy function (add_item, etc.)

ethanS -- 2021-04-29 1:00

    - users can reliably add/delete items and clear the entire list

- we tested the app on everyone's computers, but mine is the only one that doesn't work.
- i kept getting directed to the error page when i try to login or register.
- tried running it on chrome, incognito mode, safari, and firefox --> did not work
- also tried after i restarted my computer --> did not work
- also tried clearing cache --> did not work
- we don't know what is going on, but since it works on everyone else's computers it isn't a problem with the app itself
